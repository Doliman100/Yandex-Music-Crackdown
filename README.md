# Yandex-Music-Crackdown
Without a subscription, the crackdown popup displays and playback stops after 30 minutes of listening to music. This extension removes this restriction and you can listen to music non-stop all day long without a subscription.

### How it works
It intercepts the main player script at load time, and patches a function that checks the condition for displaying the popup so it never displays.
